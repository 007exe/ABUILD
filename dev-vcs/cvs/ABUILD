longdesc=("CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS. It handles multiple developers, multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control various operations, and can work over a wide area network. Some of the people who have worked on CVS include: Dick Grune, Brian Berliner, Jeff Polk, and others too numerous to mention.")
