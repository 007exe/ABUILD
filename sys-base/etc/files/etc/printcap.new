# See "man printcap" for information on editing this file.

# In most cases it is better to use a tool to write the printcap
# for you (at least initially), such as apsfilter
# (/usr/share/apsfilter/SETUP, used in conjunction with the
# LPRng lpd daemon), or with the web interface provided by the
# cupsd print daemon at this URL: http://localhost:631
# (if you use CUPS).
