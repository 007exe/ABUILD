shortdesc="Library which abstracts the storage of configuration settings"

longdesc=("mcs is a library and set of userland tools which abstract the storage of configuration settings away from userland applications. It is hoped that by using mcs, that the applications which 
use it will generally have a more congruent feeling in regards to settings. Because mcs is licenced under the BSD license, it is hoped that many applications will adopt its use. ")
