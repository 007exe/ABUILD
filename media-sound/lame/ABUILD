shortdesc=("A high quality MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3) encoder")
longdesc=("Following the great history of GNU naming, LAME originally stood for LAME Ain an Mp3 Encoder. LAME started life as a GPL patch against the dist10 ISO demonstration source, and thus was incapable of producing an mp3 stream or even being compiled by itself. But in May 2000, the last remnants of the ISO source code were replaced, and now LAME is the source code for a fully GPL'd MP3 encoder, with speed and quality to rival all commercial competitors.")
