shortdesc="A library that implements Perl 5-style regular expressions. 2nd version"
longdesc="PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE (Perl-compatible regular expression) library to provide an entirely new API. PCRE2 is written in C, and it has its own API. There are three sets of functions, one for the 8-bit library, which processes strings of bytes, one for the 16-bit library, which processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for the 32-bit library, which processes strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++ wrappers. This package provides support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8 encodings. Install %{name}-utf16 or %{name}-utf32 packages for the other ones."
