shortdesc=("A high-quality MPEG audio decoder")
longdesc=("MAD (libmad) is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies, as well as the so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented. Because MAD provides full 24-bit PCM output, applications using MAD are able to produce high quality audio. MAD is distributed under the terms of the GPL. MAD (libmad) was written by Robert Leslie.")
