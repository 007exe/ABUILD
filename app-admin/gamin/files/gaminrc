# configuration for gamin
# Can be used to override the default behaviour.
# notify filepath(s) : indicate to use kernel notification
# poll filepath(s)   : indicate to use polling instead
# fsset fsname method poll_limit : indicate what method of notification for the filesystem
#                                  kernel - use the kernel for notification
#                                  poll - use polling for notification
#                                  none - don't use any notification
#
#                                  the poll_limit is the number of seconds
#                                  that must pass before a resource is polled again.
#                                  It is optional, and if it is not present the previous
#                                  value will be used or the default.

#notify /mnt/local* /mnt/pictures* # use kernel notification on these paths
#poll /tmp/* /var/*                # use poll notification on these paths

# A safe default is to poll filesystems once every 15 seconds:
fsset btrfs poll 15
fsset cifs poll 15
fsset ext2 poll 15
fsset ext3 poll 15
fsset ext4 poll 15
fsset hfs poll 15
fsset hfsplus poll 15
fsset iso9660 poll 15
fsset jfs poll 15
fsset nfs poll 15
fsset nfs4 poll 15
fsset ntfs poll 15
fsset ntfs-3g poll 15
fsset ocfs2 poll 15
fsset reiserfs poll 15
fsset udf poll 15
fsset vfat poll 15
fsset xfs poll 15
