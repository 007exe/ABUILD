shortdesc=("An event notification library.")
longdesc=("The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and can then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop.")
