shortdesc=("mm (Shared Memory Allocation library)")
longdesc=("OSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of shared memory between forked processes. On the first layer it hides all platform dependent implementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing with shared memory segments and on the second layer it provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API to work with data inside those shared memory segments. Apache, PHP, and other projects use mm. The mm library was written by Ralf S. Engelschall.")
