longdesc=('These are the GNU core utilities, the basic command line programs such as mkdir, ls, and rm that are needed for the system to run. This package is the union of the GNU fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages. Most of these programs have significant advantages over their Unix counterparts, such as greater speed, additional options, and fewer arbitrary limits.')
