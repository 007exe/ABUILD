#  -F = show '/' for dirs, '*' for executables, etc.
#  -T 0 = don't trust tab spacing when formatting ls output.
#  -b = better support for special characters

# 'auto' colorizes output to ttys, but not pipes.
# 'always' adds color characters to all output.
# 'never' shuts colorization off.

# Assume shell aliases are supported.  Ash is going to freak out
# when it sees zsh syntax anyway, so whatever.
