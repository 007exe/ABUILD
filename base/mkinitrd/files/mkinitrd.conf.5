.TH MKINITRD.CONF 5 "27 March 2010" "Slackware 13.1"
.SH NAME 
.B mkinitrd.conf(5)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkinitrd.conf - optional configuration file for 
.I mkinitrd(8)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I mkinitrd.conf
file contains options to be passed to
.I mkinitrd(8)
on every run if mkinitrd is executed with the -F flag.  
.br 
It is intended as a fast and easy way for the system administrator to
pass options to mkinitrd without having to type them on each execution.

Options passed to 
.I mkinitrd(8)
on the command line will override any
values set in the config file.

.SH OPTIONS AND SYNTAX

All options are in the format of OPTION="value"
.br
Unset variables have no effect.

.TP 5
.I SOURCE_TREE
This is the location for the initrd's source tree.
.br
Defaults to "/boot/initrd-tree"

.TP 5
.I CLEAR_TREE
This option specifies whether to clear the initrd source tree prior to
creating the initrd. 
.br
This requires a value of either "0" or "1" where 0=no and 1=yes
.br
Examples:
.br
CLEAR_TREE="0"		# Do not clear initrd tree first
.br
CLEAR_TREE="1"		# Clear initrd tree first

It is recommended to leave this unset and pass "-c" on the command line
when clearing the tree is desired.  Clearing the tree is not desirable
if you wish to build support for more than one kernel into the initrd
image.

.TP 5
.I OUTPUT_IMAGE
This is the location for the initrd image that is created.
.br
Defaults to "/boot/initrd.gz"
.br
If %KVER% and/or %SLACKVER% are present in the string, they will be replaced 
with $KERNEL_VERSION (e.g. "4.4.75-smp") and Slackware Version (e.g. "14.2") 
respectively in the name of the generated file.

.TP 5
.I KERNEL_VERSION
This is the kernel version for which the initrd should be created.
.br
Defaults to "$(uname -r)"

.TP 5
.I KEYMAP
This is the custom keyboard map that should be loaded instead of the
default 'us' keymap.
.br
The file /usr/share/mkinitrd/keymaps.tar.gz contains all possible keymaps
to choose from (omit the '.bmap' extension in the mkinitrd command)
.br
Example: KEYMAP="nl"

.TP 5
.I MODULE_LIST
This should be a colon-separated list of modules you wish to be included
in the initrd image.  
.br
Example: MODULE_LIST="ext3:mbcache:jbd"

If you have loadtime options that you need to specify when loading kernel
modules, those can be added here as well.
.br
Example: MODULE_LIST="module1:module2 option=1:module3"

.TP 5
.I LUKSDEV
Contains a colon (:) delimited list of luks encrypted block devices to be
unlocked by the initrd using cryptsetup.  The list may include any of: device
node path, UUID, or LABEL.  All devices that must be unlocked in order to
access the root filesystem must be specified.
.sp
Example: LUKSDEV="/dev/sda2:/dev/sda3"
.br
Example: LUKSDEV="UUID=ec6dea40-c8d8-4590-850a-a757be60e45a"
.br
Example: LUKSDEV="LABEL=darkstar"

Each unlocked device will be assigned an automatically generated luks device
name of the form luks<device> where '<device>' will be the basename of the
encrypted device.  e.g.

  /dev/mapper/lukssda2

As a convenience to users, if
.I ROOTDEV
(see below) specifies one of the device names listed in the
.I LUKSDEV
option, then it will be automatically adjusted to use the correct luks
device name. i.e. when specifying
.I "LUKSDEV=/dev/sda2"
then
.I "ROOTDEV=/dev/sda2"
and
.I "ROOTDEV=/dev/mapper/lukssda2"
are equivalent.

.TP 5
.I LUKSKEY
When using cryptsetup to encrypt your partition, you can use a keyfile instead
of a passphrase to unlock the LUKS volume.  The LUKSKEY variable holds the
filename of a keyfile, as well as the label (or uuid) of the partition this
file is on.  This way, you can unlock your computer automatically if you have a
USB stick with your LUKS key inserted at boot. A passphrase will still be asked
if the LUKS key can not be found.
.br
For example, if your USB thumb drive has a FAT partition with label
"TRAVELSTICK" and the actual keyfile is called "/keys/alien.luks", then
you need to set:
.br
LUKSKEY="LABEL=TRAVELSTICK:/keys/alien.luks"

.TP 5
.I LUKSTRIM
Contains a colon (:) delimited list of luks encrypted block devices to be
passed the "--allow-discards" option when unlocked by the initrd using
cryptsetup. This has the effect of allowing TRIM on SSD drives. Be sure
your SSD supports this feature (correctly) before enabling it.
.br
See fstrim(8) for more information.
.br
Example: LUKSTRIM="/dev/sda2:/dev/sda4"

.TP 5
.I ROOTDEV
The device on which your root filesystem is located.
May be a device node path, UUID, or LABEL. See LUKSDEV examples.
.br
Example: ROOTDEV="/dev/sda2"

If you are using cryptsetup and an encrypted root filesystem, be sure to
read the option above for LUKSDEV or Bad Things will happen.

.TP 5
.I ROOTFS
The filesystem type of your root filesystem
.br
Example: ROOTFS="ext3"

.TP 5
.I RAID
This option adds the mdadm binary to the initrd to support RAID.
Additional modules may be required, depending on your kernel
configuration.  If you wish to add LVM support to the initrd, then
set this to 1; otherwise, leave it unset or set it to 0.
.br
Examples:
.br
RAID="0"          # Do not add RAID support to initrd
.br
RAID="1"          # Add RAID support to initrd

.TP 5
.I LVM
This option adds support for LVM partitions into the initrd.
If you wish to add LVM support to the initrd, then set this to 1;
otherwise, leave it unset or set it to 0.
.br
Examples:
.br
LVM="0"          # Do not add LVM support to initrd
.br
LVM="1"          # Add LVM support to initrd

.TP 5
.I UDEV
Use UDEV in the initrd.
.br
Examples:
.br
UDEV="0"	# Do not use udev in the initrd
.br
UDEV="1"	# Use udev in the initrd (this is the default)

.TP 5
.I WAIT
This defines the time to wait, in seconds, until all disks are detected.
.br
This is useful for allowing extra time that might be needed for slow usb disks or systems with large amounts of storage to become ready.
.br
If not defined, the default is 1 second.

.TP 5
.I RESUMEDEV
The swap partition holding your hibernation image.
.br
Example: RESUMEDEV="/dev/sda2"

.TP 5
.I MODCONF
This option defines whether to copy the module-init-tools config files
from /etc/modprobe.d/ into the initrd.  This will not usually be necessary,
but if you need certain modules to be loaded with special options, and you
have this configured in a file in /etc/modprobe.d/, this is one way to 
accomplish the desired goal.
.br
Examples:
.br
MODCONF="0"	# Do not add /etc/modprobe.d/* to the initrd
.br
MODCONF="1"	# Add /etc/modprobe.d/* to the initrd

.TP 5
.I MICROCODE_ARCH
This option specifies a cpio archive containing updated microcode for your CPU.
CPU manufacturers occasionally release such updates to fix bugs in the microcode
currently embedded in the CPU. The microcode archive will be prepended to the
output initrd, where the kernel will find it for early patching.
.br
Examples:
.br
MICROCODE_ARCH="/boot/intel-ucode.cpio"
