shortdesc=("A fork of i3-wm tiling window manager with more features, including gaps.")
longdesc=("Key features of i3 are correct handling multi-monitor, horizontal and vertical columns (table abstraction) in tiling. It also provides hooks/callbacks for other programs to integrate and it is UTF-8 clean. i3 uses xcb for asynchronous communication with X11, and has several measures to be very fast.")
