longdesc=("This package contains a collection of user space tools for general SMBus access and hardware monitoring. SMBus, also known as System Management Bus, is a protocol for communicating through a I2C ('I squared C') bus. Many modern mainboards have a System Management Bus. There are a lot of devices which can be connected to a SMBus; the most notable are modern memory chips with EEPROM memories and chips for hardware monitoring.")
