longdesc=("OpenGFX is an open source graphics base set for OpenTTD which can completely replace the TTD base set. The main goal of OpenGFX therefore is to provide a set of free base graphics which make it possible to play OpenTTD without requiring the (copyrighted) files from the TTD CD. This potentially increases the OpenTTD fanbase and makes it a true free game. http://wiki.openttd.org/OpenGFX_Readme")
