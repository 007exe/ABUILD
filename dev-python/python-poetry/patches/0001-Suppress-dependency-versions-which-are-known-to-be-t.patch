poetry habitually engages in:

* dependency versions which are known to be too pessimistic
* multiple editions of dependencies per python version

The former all work just fine in reported use and should not be pinned; we
package versions in Arch which are "too new". This is what unittests are
for, anyway.

The latter tries to enforce minimum versions of dependencies, but pins
it twice, once with more relaxed pinning for older versions of python.
If an old version works, it works irrespective of the python version,
and you don't need to use minimum requirements as your mallet to force
people to upgrade to the latest version anyway.
